Title: Understanding the Influence of Environmental Factors on Bitcoin Prices

Description: This project explores how various environmental factors impact the price of Bitcoin (BTC). By analyzing data related to CPU usage, VIX (Volatility Index), monthly energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and energy efficiency, insights were gained into the relationship between these factors and BTC prices. Notably, monthly energy consumption emerged as a significant influencer, exhibiting a correlation coefficient of 0.8 with BTC prices.

Purpose: The aim of this project is to shed light on the environmental dynamics affecting the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, and to provide valuable insights for investors, policymakers, and researchers.
